  <p>The E30 3 Series began production in 1982 as the replacement for the E21, which had been the first of the now famous 3 Series cars,
and lasted into the 90s, with some versions being available up until the 1994 model year.
The E30 carried over several features from the E21 including the M10 engine as a four cylinder option and styling such as the curved rear window known as the Hofmeister kink.
 The E30 continued with other BMW traditions such as the twin “kidney” grills and two separate headlight bulbs on each side,
 which would be combined into one headlight unit for each side for subsequent 3 Series models.</p>
<br>

<p>What really set the E30 apart from its predecessor early on was the fact that it was available in a wide range of body styles during its production run.
 The E21 might have been the first 3 Series, but it was a replacement for the 2002 coupe and carried over many old features including a two door coupe being the only body style available from the factory over its lifetime.
 The E30 3 Series could be purchased as a two-door coupe, two door convertible, four-door sedan, and even as a BMW E30 wagon, of which very few have made it to the U.S.
 One of the most famous and sought-after BMW models is the E30 M3 which featured wider fender flares amongst other upgrades that make it stand out from anything else on the road. </p>
<br>
<p>The BMW E30 M3 arrived in 1986 as the first in a long line of M3 cars,
 and was in production until 1991 when it was replaced by the E36 M3. 
 It was initially developed to be a homologation special for the DTM racing series,
 which required a production run of five thousand cars to be eligible to race. It made its debut in 1985 and was an instant head turner.
It was available both as a two-door coupe and a convertible, but while almost 18,000 E30 M3s were produced for the global market,
 less than 800 were convertibles, and only a few of those have made it to U.S. shores.</p>
<br>
<p>At first glance the E30 M3 looks similar to an E30 coupe,
but the M3 shares very little in common with its E30 counterparts.
 Visually the M3 looks different due to its wide fender flares and raised trunk lid,
which allowed for bigger and wider wheels and better aerodynamics.
 Its upgraded suspension and brakes featured many bespoke components such as bigger brakes and five stud wheels instead of the four stud options found on other E30s.
The M3’s four-cylinder S14 engines featured a cylinder head based on the six-cylinder S38 found in earlier BMW M cars.
 All E30 M3s came equipped with a five-speed Getrag manual transmission.
The E30 M3 produced up to 234hp and weighed less than 3,000 lbs which made it one of the best handling cars not only of its era,
 but of all time.</p>

<h2>The era of Mercedes</h2>
<div id="mercedes"></div>
<br>
<p>War has a habit of pushing innovation, and the battle,
 this time was on the tarmac and the shots were fired from the exhaust pipes.
 The automotive industry in the 80s was not at its best place and due to the oil
 crisis in the 70’s the racing cars derived from road-going counterparts were 
getting lighter and smaller every passing day.</p>

<p>During that era in Germany,
 the king of the small touring cars was Mercedes,
 their 190E was not only the best-selling German car but also was making waves on the racetrack. 
The Mercedes 190E was created with the help of AMG, and their eye was on the 
upcoming series of motorsports called the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft or DTM.
 It was started in 1984 to help promote the finest cars from the Deutschland and prove their
 engineering prowess to the world.</p>
 
 <p> Going back to DTM, 
  along with the new racing series the infamous
  Nurburgring has also just reopened repairs and extensive renovations.
  Thus to celebrate both things, the Race of Champions was held at “The Ring”
  where only Mercedes 190E race cars were driven by some of the best drivers
  of that time, and none other than Aryton Senna took the first place.
 </p>

 <h2>The battle between Stuttgart</h2>
 <div id="BobLutz"></div>
 <br>
 <p>The whole period of Mercedes was making BMW mad as hell and they were
 not going to take it anymore. With the help of Bob Lutz, BMW created the
 M division to handle all of their motorsport operations, however, 
 they were stuck in the past with their big heavy cars that were not good 
 enough to deal with the lightweight touring cars like the 190E.</p>
 <p>Rules make races,
   and strict rules get the team to their paces to get a competitive advantage.
    With the long list of rules in the DTM, there was one bizarre one called 
  the homologation cars which means the manufacturer has to produce and sell
  ome amount of cars to be allowed to race. In general, the homologation 
  numbers are somewhere around 500 cars, however, in DTM, the homologation
  numbers were set to 5,000 examples a year, which pushed the manufacturer 
  to use one of the production cars for the race.</p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Lutz_(businessman)"><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-514679872-1565723924.jpg?crop=0.8888888888888888xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*" alt="Bob Lutz" width="700"class="center"></a>
  <p>Thus BMW at the start of DTM participated with their 635CSI
   and actually won their first championship when Volker Strycek 
   managed to stay ahead of everyone. The very next year through
  the 6-series proved to be heavier to compete with the new lightweight
   designed cars inspired by Group B.</p>
   <h3>The future of motorsports meant small, lightweight, and efficient designs</h3>
   <p>It was inevitable that BMW race cars needed some major improvements
     and if they didn’t the future was led by Mercedes and their 190E.
    This was not acceptable by Eberhard Von Kuenheim the CEO of BMW at that time,
     and thanks to him the BMW name would not be dragged through mud.</p>

     <P>He wanted BMW on top, and with the help of Bob Lutz and the new M division,
   he pushed the company in a brand-new direction. BMW was fully committed to 
   making new cars that were not mere machines to take you from point A to B, 
   they wanted to create the ultimate driving machines that do not go obsolete 
   when the next generations arrive.</P>
   <p>At that time the small lightweight car
     of their lineup was the 3-series, however
     , it was not up to the mark to compete with
     rivals like Mercedes and Ford. The car came
    with an anemic engine that they had been using
    since the 1960s, and the bay was also small
     enough to hold their race-derived engines.
      However the chassis had the potential,
    and despite using the 3 series, they
     used it as a base for their new sportscar
     and the development of the E30 M3 commenced,</p>

     <h2>BMW’s ultimate driving machine</h2>
     <div id="Drive"></div>
     <br>
     <p>The M division was given the task of making 
      the car that won everything and presenting the
       brand on a global stage with all its glory. Th
       ey started by taking a 325i into their garage,
        stripped everything off of it, and started working
        on making the chassis rigid. They also needed a new
         engine since the one that came with the normal car
     was not enough to surpass the opponents.</p>
     <p>This was not the most difficult task since
       BMW at that time was well versed in making 
       some of the greatest internal combustion engines,
        and the only problem this time was to make it small.
         The task was handed down to arguably one of the
          greatest engine designers of all time Paul Rosche.</p>
     <p>The man decided to use the M10 engine which
       was a robust 4-cylinder block that also inspired 
       Formula 1’s most powerful engine to date the M12
        and M13. For the finishing touches, the man took
         the heads from his legendary M88 engine and sliced
          off two cylinder banks to fit it on top of the M10.
           The engine also gets individual throttle bodies and
      the internals were also beefed up to take the thrashing
             of high-level racing.</p>  
   <p>All these efforts resulted
     in a small and lightweight beast 
     of an engine called the S14, which
      was given to it because Paul Rosche 
  only took 14 days to design the complete 
  engine. The S14 got paired with a Getrag 
  5-speed dogleg gearbox which is certainly 
  helpful on the racetrack as it saves 10th of seconds between shifts.</p>
  <p>No stones were left unturned in the case of the M3,
  as suspension, brakes, and exhausts were all changed
  for lightweight and durability. The car also got wider
  and lighter and an extra stroud was also included per
   wheel so it could withstand the forces of racing. Apart
  from the hood, roof panel, sunroof, and inner door panels,
   everything was changed which made the M3 basically a new car.
    Now the problem arises for the homologate car they needed to
  sell 5000 of them.</p>

  <h2>It sold like hotcakes</h2> 
  <p>Initially, BMW was skeptical
   about whether they’d be able
   to sell 5000 of the M3s or
    not, however by looking at
     the sheer dominance on the
   racetrack people got intrigued and
    wanted one in their garage. They
    wanted to feel the rush of the
   S14 engine and the pinpoint accurate movement of the car. It did not take BMW to sell 10,000 of them before the M factory could not meet the demand.</p>           
<p>This was not a road car that was
   converted for racing, it was a racecar
  for everyday people. The predictable
   nature helped many individuals to learn
  the nitty gritty of racing, and since
  the underpinnings were from a basic 3
   series, it did all that while being 
   comfortable too. The E30 M3 was a great
   car, and it performed evenly no matter the road condition,
   it was the emblem of the finest automotive engineering, and
    in skillful hands, it became a weapon of mass destruction.</p>
